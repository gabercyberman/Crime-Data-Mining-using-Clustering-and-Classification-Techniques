# Crime Rate Prediction & Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project analyzes and predicts crime incidents using real-world crime data. It covers exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, normalization, splitting the dataset, applying two data mining techniques (KMeans clustering and Decision Tree classification), evaluation, and multiple visualizations, all through an interactive GUI.

## Objectives
1. Understand and analyze the dataset (EDA)
2. Clean and preprocess the data (handle missing values, duplicates, wrong data types, etc.)
3. Normalize features for better model performance
4. Split the data into training and testing sets
5. Apply data mining techniques: KMeans clustering and Decision Tree classification
6. Evaluate the results using accuracy and classification metrics
7. Visualize the data with Histogram, Pie Chart, Box Plot, and Scatter Plot
8. Provide an easy-to-use graphical interface (GUI)

## How to Run
1. **Create and activate a virtual environment** (recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv myenv
   source myenv/bin/activate
   ```
2. **Install the requirements:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```



## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- See `requirements.txt` for all dependencies

## Dataset
- Place your dataset (e.g., `train.csv`) in the project folder.
- The file should contain columns: `Dates, Category, Descript, DayOfWeek, PdDistrict, Resolution, Address, X, Y`
